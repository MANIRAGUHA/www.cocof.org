<p>The Advisory Council on Women (Conseil Consultatif des 
          Femmes, “COCOF”) is a women's organization of Rwandan established under 
          law in December 1994 by a group of peasant women from the former Commune 
          of Musumbira (current Kamonyi District). The aim of this organization 
          was to improve the socio-economic development of rural women and safeguard 
          their rights. At its inception, COCOF counted 77 women. Currently, it 
          includes 545 members exclusively females, and 4,281 beneficiaries both 
          sexes, with 75% females. All the members were grouped into 15 cooperatives.</p>
